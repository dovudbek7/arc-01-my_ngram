# Descriprion
"
The N-Gram Project in C is a simple implementation of n-gram analysis, a technique used to extract and examine contiguous sequences of items (usually words) from a given text. This project provides a basic framework for understanding and implementing n-gram analysis, allowing users to explore the local linguistic patterns within a text.
"
# Task
"
The primary task of this project is to analyze a text and generate n-grams of a specified size. In the context of this implementation, n-grams refer to consecutive sequences of words in the input text. The project aims to facilitate a straightforward exploration of n-grams, enabling users to observe patterns and relationships within the provided textual data.

# Usage
"
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
